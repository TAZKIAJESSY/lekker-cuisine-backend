# LEKKER CUISINE SERVER ü•ïü•óüë©‚Äçüç≥

Lekker Cuisine is a cooking app characterized by distinctive ingredients, techniques and dishes, and usually associated with a specific culture or geographic region. For me Cooking is an absolutely special process. Some see this as a highly artistic event, while for others it‚Äôs just a daily routine. Yet, no matter on which side you are ‚Äî cooking app development is something that can help lots of people. So helping people more elaborately this app consists of shopping list of missing ingredients for a specific cuisine, a user want to try. This will encourage people to use the application more frequently (not only when they‚Äôre preparing food but also during shopping).
